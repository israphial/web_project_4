**Introduction**

Project 4 mixes HTML/CSS responsive design principles and Javascript to create a webpage that allows the client to edit certain elements of the profile. This is done via a popup window triggered via the edit button.
The Nested BEM methodology is used to organize the filestructure, as well as the various entities that make up the page. 
Additionally, the version history of this project may be messy, as I am using this project to experiment with and learn about git branches, merges, merge conflict resolution, and various other git conventions. My intent is to build features in branches that get merged with the branch called "develop", and the develop branch will periodically be merged into master at "stable" points in the process (upon each major revision of the project). The conventions I will be following are to prefix all branches with a title, such as feature/featureName, fix/fixName, etc. I will also be using imperative language for commits. 

**Technologies**

* Figma for the page design
* Chrome DevTools for developing and debugging
* VSCode and MinGW64 CLI for developing
* TinyPNG for image compression
* Git/GitHub for version control
* GitHub Pages for hosting
