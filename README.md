**Introduction**

Project 4 mixes HTML/CSS responsive design principles and Javascript to create a webpage that allows the client to edit certain elements of the profile. This is done via a popup window triggered via the edit button.
The Nested BEM methodology is used to organize the filestructure, as well as the various entities that make up the page. 
Additionally, the version history of this project may be messy, as I am using this project to experiment with and learn about git branches, merges, merge conflict resolution, and various other git conventions. My intent is to build features in branches that get merged with the branch called "develop", and the develop branch will periodically be merged into master at "stable" points in the process (upon each major revision of the project). The conventions I will be following are to prefix all branches with a title, such as feature/featureName, fix/fixName, etc. I will also be using imperative language for commits. 

Project 5 expands on Project 4 by adding far more interactivity on the page. Cards are now more malleable, allowing the user to add their own custom cards, as well as remove existing cards. There are a few more animations added to various elements of the page, new functionality for the "like" buttons on each card, and a new popup that expands the picture of a card when clicked. Most of these additions will be done primarily through JavaScript DOM manipulation. At the moment, changes are not saved between reloads, as a backend server or DB has not been attached to the site. 

**Technologies**

* HTML/CSS for markup
* Javascript for interactivity
* Mousetrap JS Library for some hotkey functionality - credit to Craig Campbell for his great library!
* Nested BEM for conventional structuring
* Figma for the page design
* Chrome DevTools for developing and debugging
* VSCode and MinGW64 CLI for developing
* TinyPNG for image compression
* Git/GitHub for version control
* GitHub Pages for hosting
