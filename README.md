**Introduction**

Across The US is a series of projects done by me for Practicum by Yandex. The early iterations of this site build on markup principles, laying out the visuals for the site. The Nested BEM methodology are used to structure the CSS. Responsive Design practices are used to make the site easily usable on all common device resolutions. JS-based Live form validation is introduced early on, allowing us to make it as easy as possible for our users to customize their profiles and cards.

Starting at Project 5, the interactivity and capability of the site is expanded to do things like load the cards from an array of objects, allow user control via several interactive popups and elements, and personalize certain aspects of the page. As I moved further into the projects, I added things such as Prototypal Inheritance, Polymorphism of various popup classes, asynchronous API interaction, JS Modules, and various building/deployment tools.

This site is intended to be fully interactive and seamless, such that the user doesn't need to jump between a bunch of different pages to interface with the site. All user operations are done through popups and interactive elements that immediately change the page without the need for refreshing or redirecting.
