**Introduction**

Project 4 mixes HTML/CSS responsive design principles and a bit of Javascript to create a simple webpage that allows the user to edit certain elements on the page. 
The BEM methodology is used to organize the filestructure, as well as the various entities that make up the page. 
Additionally, the version history of this project may be messy, as I am using this project to experiment with and learn about git branches, merges, merge conflict resolution, and conventions. My intent is to build features in branches that get merged with the branch called "develop", and the develop branch will periodically be merged into master at "stable" points in the process. The conventions I will be following are to prefix all branches with a title, such as feature/featureName, hotfix/hotfixName, etc. I will also be using imperative language for commits.

**Technologies**

* HTML/CSS for markup
* Javascript for interactivity
* Nested BEM for conventional structuring
* Figma for the page design
* Chrome DevTools for developing and debugging
* VSCode for developing
* TinyPNG for image compression
* Unsplash for copyright-free images
* Git/GitHub for version control
* GitHub Pages for hosting
